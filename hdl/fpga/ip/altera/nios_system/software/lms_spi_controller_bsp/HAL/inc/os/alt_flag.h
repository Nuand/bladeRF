/*
 * This header provides macro definitions that can be used to create and use
 * uc/OS-II style event flags. These macros can be used in both a uC/OS-II based 
 * environment, and a single threaded HAL based environment.
 *
 * The motivation for these macros is to allow code to be developed which is
 * thread safe under uC/OS-II, but incurs no additional overhead when used in a
 * single threaded HAL environment.  
 *
 * In the case of a single threaded HAL environment, they compile to 
 * "do nothing" directives, which ensures they do not contribute to the final
 * executable.
 *
 * The following macros are available:
 *
 * ALT_FLAG_GRP        - Create a flag group instance.
 * ALT_EXTERN_FLAG_GRP - Create a reference to an external flag group instance.
 * ALT_STATIC_FLAG_GRP - Create a static flag group instance.
 * ALT_FLAG_CREATE     - Initialise a flag group.
 * ALT_FLAG_PEND       - Pend on a flag group.
 * ALT_FLAG_POST       - Set a flag condition.
 
 *
 * Input arguments and return codes are all consistant with the equivalent
 * uC/OS-II function.
 *
 * It's important to be careful in the use of the macros: ALT_FLAG_GRP, 
 * ALT_EXTERN_FLAG_GRP, and ALT_STATIC_FLAG_GRP. In these three cases the 
 * semi-colon is included in the macro definition; so, for example, you should 
 * use:
 *
 * ALT_FLAG_GRP(mygroup)
 *
 * not:
 *
 * ALT_FLAG_GRP(mygroup);
 *
 * The inclusion of the semi-colon has been necessary to ensure the macros can
 * compile with no warnings when used in a single threaded HAL environment.
