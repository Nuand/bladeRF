/*
 * errno is defined in <errno.h> so that it uses the thread local version 
 * stored in the location pointed to by "_impure_ptr". This means that the 
 * accesses to errno within the HAL library can cause the entirety of 
 * of the structure pointed to by "_impure_ptr" to be added to the 
 * users application. This can be undesirable in very small footprint systems.
 *
 * To avoid this happening, the HAL uses the macro ALT_ERRNO, defined below,
 * to access errno, rather than accessing it directly. This macro will only 
 * use the thread local version if some other code has already caused it to be 
 * included into the system, otherwise it will use the global errno value.
 *
 * This causes a slight increases in code size where errno is accessed, but 
 * can lead to significant overall benefits in very small systems. The 
 * increase is inconsequential when compared to the size of the structure
 * pointed to by _impure_ptr.
 *
 * Note that this macro accesses __errno() using an externally declared 
 * function pointer (alt_errno). This is done so that the function call uses the
 * subroutine call instruction via a register rather than an immediate address.
 * This is important in the case that the code has been linked for a high
 * address, but __errno() is not being used. In this case the weak linkage
 * would have resulted in the instruction: "call 0" which would fail to link.
