/*
 * alt_no_error() is a dummy function used by alt_sem.h and alt_flag.h. It
 * substitutes for functions that have a return code by creating a function 
 * that always returns zero. 
 *
 * This may seem a little obscure, but what happens is that the compiler can 
 * then optomise away the call to this function, and any code written which
 * handles the error path (i.e. non zero return values). 
 *
 * This allows code to be written which correctly use the uC/OS-II semaphore
 * and flag utilities, without the use of those utilities impacting on 
 * excutables built for a single threaded HAL environment.
 *
 * This function is considered to be part of the internal implementation of
 * the HAL, and should not be called directly by application code or device
 * drivers. It is not guaranteed to be preserved in future versions of the
 * HAL.
