/*
 * This header provides macro definitions that can be used to create and use
 * semaphores. These macros can be used in both a uC/OS-II based environment,
 * and a single threaded HAL based environment.
 *
 * The motivation for these macros is to allow code to be developed which is
 * thread safe under uC/OS-II, but incurs no additional overhead when used in a
 * single threaded HAL environment.  
 *
 * In the case of a single threaded HAL environment, they compile to 
 * "do nothing" directives, which ensures they do not contribute to the final
 * executable.
 *
 * The following macros are available:
 *
 * ALT_SEM        - Create a semaphore instance.
 * ALT_EXTERN_SEM - Create a reference to an external semaphore instance.
 * ALT_STATIC_SEM - Create a static semaphore instance.
 * ALT_SEM_CREATE - Initialise a semaphore.
 * ALT_SEM_PEND   - Pend on a semaphore.
 * ALT_SEM_POST   - Increment a semaphore.
 *
 * Input arguments and return codes are all consistant with the equivalent
 * uC/OS-II function.
 *
 * It's important to be careful in the use of the macros: ALT_SEM, 
 * ALT_EXTERN_SEM, and ALT_STATIC_SEM. In these three cases the semi-colon is
 * included in the macro definition; so, for example, you should use:
 *
 * ALT_SEM(mysem)
 *
 * not:
 *
 * ALT_SEM(mysem);
 *
 * The inclusion of the semi-colon has been necessary to ensure the macros can
 * compile with no warnings when used in a single threaded HAL environment.
