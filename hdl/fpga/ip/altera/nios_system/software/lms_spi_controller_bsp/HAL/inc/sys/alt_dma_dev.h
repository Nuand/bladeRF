/*
 * This header contains the device driver interface for accessing DMA 
 * resources. See alt_dma.h for the DMA application side interface.
 *
 * The interface model treats a DMA transaction as being composed of two 
 * halves (read and write). 
 *
 * An "alt_dma_txchan_dev" is used to describe the device associated with a
 * DMA transmit channel. An "alt_dma_rxchan_dev" is used to describe the
 * device associated with a DMA receive channel. 
 */

/*
 * List of generic ioctl requests that may be supported by a DMA device.
 *
 * ALT_DMA_RX_ONLY_ON:    This causes a DMA channel to operate in a mode
 *                        where only the receiver is under software control.
 *                        The other side reads continously from a single
 *                        location. The address to read is the argument to
 *                        this request.
 * ALT_DMA_RX_ONLY_OFF:   Return to the default mode where both the receive
 *                        and transmit sides of the DMA can be under software
 *                        control.
 * ALT_DMA_TX_ONLY_ON:    This causes a DMA channel to operate in a mode
 *                        where only the transmitter is under software control.
 *                        The other side writes continously to a single
 *                        location. The address to write to is the argument to
 *                        this request.
 * ALT_DMA_TX_ONLY_OFF:   Return to the default mode where both the receive
 *                        and transmit sides of the DMA can be under software
 *                        control.
 * ALT_DMA_SET_MODE_8:    Transfer data in units of 8 bits.
 * ALT_DMA_SET_MODE_16:   Transfer data in units of 16 bits.
 * ALT_DMA_SET_MODE_32:   Transfer data in units of 32 bits.
 * ALT_DMA_SET_MODE_64:   Transfer data in units of 64 bits.
 * ALT_DMA_SET_MODE_128:  Transfer data in units of 128 bits.
 * ALT_DMA_GET_MODE:      Get the current transfer mode.
 *
 * The use of the macros: ALT_DMA_TX_STREAM_ON, ALT_DMA_TX_STREAM_OFF
 * ALT_DMA_RX_STREAM_OFF and ALT_DMA_RX_STREAM_ON are depreciated. You should
 * instead use the macros: ALT_DMA_RX_ONLY_ON, ALT_DMA_RX_ONLY_OFF, 
 * ALT_DMA_TX_ONLY_ON and ALT_DMA_TX_ONLY_OFF.
