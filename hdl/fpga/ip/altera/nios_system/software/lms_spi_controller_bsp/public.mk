#                       BSP "PUBLIC" MAKEFILE CONTENT
#
# This file is intended to be included in an application or library
# Makefile that is using this BSP. You can create such a Makefile with
# the nios2-app-generate-makefile or nios2-lib-generate-makefile
# commands.
#
# The following variables must be defined before including this file:
#
#     ALT_LIBRARY_ROOT_DIR
#         Contains the path to the BSP top-level (aka root) directory

# Include paths:
# The path to root of all header files that a library wishes to make
# available for an application's use is specified here. Note that this
# may not be *all* folders within a hierarchy. For example, if it is
# desired that the application developer type:
#   #include <sockets.h>
#   #include <ip/tcpip.h>
# With files laid out like this:
#   <root of library>/inc/sockets.h
#   <root of library>/inc/ip/tcpip.h
#
# Then, only <root of library>/inc need be added to the list of include
# directories. Alternatively, if you wish to be able to directly include
# all files in a hierarchy, separate paths to each folder in that
# hierarchy must be defined.

# The following are the "base" set of include paths for a BSP.
# These paths are appended to the list that individual software
# components, drivers, etc., add in the generated portion of this
# file (below).
