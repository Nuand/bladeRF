# This program currently uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW), which
# does not appear to be supported on Windows or OSX.

# Given that this is really only intended for use as a benchmark for changes to
# the NIOS II code, it probably won't get much general use, so we'll just
# leave this as-is for now.
