v1.2.1 (2015-02-28)
--------------------------------
This version of libbladeRF is intended for use with:

FX3 Firmware v1.8.0
FPGA         v0.1.2

Changes:
  * Build fixes for MinGW (cross-compilation) and OSX

v1.2.0 (2015-01-31)
--------------------------------
This version of libbladeRF is intended for use with:

FX3 Firmware v1.8.0
FPGA         v0.1.2

Changes:
  * Added support for BLADERF_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. This controls
     the default verbosity of libbladeRF and may be set to one of the following
     strings: critical, error, warning, info, debug, verbose.
  * Syslog support has been introduced to aid in debugging of applications that
     suppress libbladeRF's stderr output. This can be enabled at compile-time
     via the ENABLE_LIBBLADERF_SYSLOG CMake option, which defaults to OFF.
  * Linux: A port reset is now performed when opening a device. This addresses
     an issue where the bladeRF could not be opened after an application
     crashes. (Fixes issue #95.)
  * Fixed signal quality issues caused by LPF DC calibration comparators
     being left on. Prior to the associated changes, significant images in the
     spectrum could be observed prior to performing DC calibration routines.
  * Fixed XB-200 signal attenuation issues that occurred when bypassing the
     XB-200 mixer (i.e., operating in the normal bladeRF tuning range with
     an XB-200 attached).
  * LMS DC cal registers are now loaded from tables at every device open()
     rather than just during the post-FPGA load initialization. This ensures
     that values from updated tables are used.
  * Fixed probe() implementation in Cypress backend to correctly report
     devices that are already opened.

v1.1.0 (2014-12-23)
--------------------------------
This version of libbladeRF is intended for use with:

FX3 Firmware v1.8.0
FPGA         v0.1.2

Changes:
  * Added bladerf_get_bootloader_list() API function to allow applications to
     detect devices in bootloader mode.
  * Added bladerf_load_fw_from_bootloader() API function to allow applications
     to download firmware to devices in bootloader mode.
  * File searching (e.g., for host-based FPGA loading) now searches the
     following, prior to the currently search paths:
       - The directory specified by the BLADERF_SEARCH_DIR environment variable
       - The current working directory
       - The directory containing the running executable
  * Removed library [INFO] message about detected devices in bootloader mode.
     This is now done in the bladeRF-cli program.
  * Fixed build issue that resulted in libusb version not being reported
     correctly in verbose log output.


v1.0.0 (2014-11-29)
--------------------------------
This version of libbladeRF is intended for use with:

FX3 Firmware v1.8.0
FPGA         v0.1.2

Changes:
 * Major version number bumped to indicate stable API.
 * Removed stdbool.h inclusion for C++ code in API header.
 * Fixed USB control transfer issue that caused SPI flash corruption
   in Windows when using libusb with the WinUSB driver.
 * When an FPGA is autoloading from SPI flash, the bladerf_open() and
   bladerf_open_with_devinfo() calls now wait for the autoload to complete.
     * This requires FW v1.8.0.

v0.17.0 (2014-10-30)
--------------------------------
This version of libbladeRF is intended for use with:

FX3 Firmware v1.7.1
FPGA         v0.1.1

Changes:

    modifications to the bladerf_metadata structure and the introduction of the
    BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16_Q11_META format.
 * libbladeRF functions have been made thread-safe.
 * The Windows installation directory is now searched when performing
    host-based FPGA and DC calibration file auto-loading.
 * Improved log output; moved output to more appropriate levels and included
    filename and line number log messages.
 * Removed BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16Q12 reverse compatibility macro.
 * Added macro definitions for FPGA configuration bits:
    - BLADERF_GPIO_COUNTER_ENABLE
    - BLADERF_GPIO_TIMESTAMP
    - BLADERF_GPIO_TIMESTAMP_DIV2
 * Fixed bugs that caused deadlocks and crashes.
 * Fixed device probe/open functions to continue searching for devices
    if a failing or busy device is encountered.
 * Improved API documentation and included more complete example usages
    of the synchronous interface. Snippets from programs in doc/examples are
    now included in the Doxygen output.
