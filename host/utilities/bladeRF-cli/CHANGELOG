================================================================================

v1.3.1 (2016-01-05)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.5.1.

  * Addressed warnings that occur with GCC -Os flag.

v1.3.0 (2015-12-31)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.5.0.

 * Marked 'set frequency <value>' deprecated.
    - Use 'set frequency rx <value>' or 'set frequency tx <value>'
 * Updated DC calibration routines for improved accuracy and to avoid lockups
 * Added print/set support for VCTCXO tamer mode

 * Added ability to set SMB master frequency
 * Added print/set support FPGA RX FIFO input mux (rx_mux)
 * Fixed regression in set xb_gpio[_dir] register-level access
 * Fixed issues with validating and applying rational sample rates
 * Output formatting cleanup

v1.2.1 (2015-07-16)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.4.1.

 * Fixed issue where transmission could be truncated due to TX RFFE being
   turned off before sample buffers reach the transceiver.

 * Fixed errors and inconsistencies in interactive command help text.

v1.2.0 (2015-06-30)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.4.0.

 * Added support for semicolon command separators
 * Added 'print trimdac' support. (Requires FPGA v0.3.2)
 * Fixed libbladeRF return value translation bugs

v1.1.2 (2015-02-28)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.2.1.

 * Fixed and improved help text and manual page generation.The doc generation
   scripts should now be compatible with formats used by pandoc 1.12.x and
   1.13.x.

v1.1.1 (2015-01-31)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.2.0.

 * Updated LMS bit definitions for 'peek/poke lms' commands to include bits
   previously marked "spare."

 * Fixed a documentation build issue caused by help2man usage.


v1.1.0 (2014-12-23)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.1.0.

 * The -p/--probe command line option now causes bladeRF-cli to return a
    non-zero return value if no devices are found. This is intended to allow
    shell scripts to easily check if devices are (not) present.

 * The 'probe' command now takes an optional 'strict' argument to specify that
    the lack of any identified devices should be treated as an error, which
    would cause scripts or a list of '-e' command line arguments to terminate
    immediately.

 * Before entering interactive mode, script parsing, or '-e' option execution,
    bladeRF-cli now searches for devices in bootloader modes and prompts the
    user to run 'help recover' for instructions on loading firmware onto these
    devices. This replaces the [INFO] log message previously printed by
    lower-level libbladeRF code.

v1.0.0 (2014-11-29)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.0.0.

      introduced without a change to the major version number.
