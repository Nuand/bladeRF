--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.4.0 or later.

v1.1.2 (2015-02-28)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.2.1 or later.

 * Fixed and improved help text and manual page generation.The doc generation
   scripts should now be compatible with formats used by pandoc 1.12.x and
   1.13.x.

v1.1.1 (2015-01-31)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.2.0 or later.

 * Updated LMS bit definitions for 'peek/poke lms' commands to include bits
   previously marked "spare."

 * Fixed a documentation build issue caused by help2man usage.


v1.1.0 (2014-12-23)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.1.0 or later.

 * The -p/--probe command line option now causes bladeRF-cli to return a
    non-zero return value if no devices are found. This is intended to allow
    shell scripts to easily check if devices are (not) present.

 * The 'probe' command now takes an optional 'strict' argument to specify that
    the lack of any identified devices should be treated as an error, which
    would cause scripts or a list of '-e' command line arguments to terminate
    immediately.

 * Before entering interactive mode, script parsing, or '-e' option execution,
    bladeRF-cli now searches for devices in bootloader modes and prompts the
    user to run 'help recover' for instructions on loading firmware onto these
    devices. This replaces the [INFO] log message previously printed by
    lower-level libbladeRF code.

v1.0.0 (2014-11-29)
--------------------------------
This version depends upon libbladeRF v1.0.0 or later.

 * Major version number incremented.

      introduced without a change to the major version number.
