Description: Nuand bladeRF software-defined radio device
 The Nuand bladeRF is an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) system,
 comprised of an RF transceiver, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
 a microcontroller driving a USB 3.0 interface, and a suite of host
 libraries and drivers to facilitate interaction with the device.
 .
 This package provides the host library.

Description: Nuand bladeRF FPGA bitstream downloader (hostedx40)
 This package will, at the time of installation, download an appropriate
 FPGA bitstream for using the Nuand bladeRF in a hosted (USB-controlled)
 configuration.  The FPGA bitstream will be downloaded from
 https://nuand.com/fpga/ and saved to /usr/share/Nuand/bladeRF.
 .
 This bitstream is for the bladeRF x40 with the Altera Cyclone IV
 EP4CE40 FPGA.
 .
 Note that this will not upgrade the bladeRF itself.  That can be done
 with the bladeRF-cli utility.
