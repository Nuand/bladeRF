Description: Interface to the nuand bladeRF software-defined radio device
 The nuand bladeRF is an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) system,
 comprised of an RF transceiver, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
 a microcontroller driving a USB 3.0 interface, and a suite of host
 libraries and drivers to facilitate interaction with the device.
 .
 This package provides the host library.
