# bladeRF Linux Applications #
This directory contains applications that utilize libbladeRF.  Currently, this consists of a command-line `bladeRF-cli` tool intended to aid in development and testing.  This tool can be used in a batch mode with single, simple operations but the real power is when it is compiled with an interactive shell.

## Dependencies ##
- [libbladeRF][lib]
- [libtecla][tecla] (optional)

[libtecla][tecla] can be installed via most package managers.  Check your distribution for support.

[lib]: ../lib (libbladeRF)
[tecla]: http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/ (libtecla)

## Building ##
1. Run `make` or `make DEBUG=y` (to build with debug symbols)
2. Note that the CLI program has been created: `bin/bladeRF-cli`

By default, bladeRF-cli uses libtecla to provide an interactive console. To disable this, include `INTERACTIVE=n`:

```
make INTERACTIVE=n
```

## Basic Usage ##
For usage information, run:

```
./bladeRF-cli --help
```

If you encounter issues and ask folks on IRC or in the forum assistance, it's always helpful to note the CLI version:

```
./bladeRF-cli --version
```

If only one device is connected, the -d option is not needed. The CLI will find and open the attached device. This option is required if multiple devices are connected. For the sake of completeness, the following examples will include this command line option.

Load the FPGA and enter interactive mode:

```
./bladeRF-cli -d /dev/bladerf0 -l /path/to/fpga.rbf
```

Pass in a script to run to setup a device in a specific way, and then interactive mode.

```
./bladeRF-cli -d /dev/bladerf0 -s setup.txt
```

Load the FPGA, setup the device, but to do not enter interactive mode:

```
./bladeRF-cli -d /dev/bladerf0 -l /path/to/fpga.rbf -s setup.txt -b
```

## Some Useful Interactive Commands ##
The `help` command prints out the top level commands that are available. Using `help <cmd>` gives a more detailed help on that command.

The most useful control commands are `peek` and `poke` for setting registers at a very basic level and `print` and `set` for performing system level tasks like setting gains, frequency, bandwidth or sample rate.

The `rx` and `tx` commands allow data to be transmitted and received in the background, while the interactive console remains in the foreground. 

`rx config` and `tx config` are used to configure and view various RX and TX parameters. Note that `rx` and `tx` is a supported shorthand for viewing the RX/TX configuration. See `help rx` and `help tx` for more information about these parameters. Below are a few examples:

Receive 10,000 samples to a binary file (host endianness):
```
rx config file=samples.bin format=bin n=10000
rx start
```

`rx` or `rx config` may be used to view the RX task status. When it no longer reports "Running", the samples should be available in the file. Note that for larger sample rate or small values of `n`, the RX task may finish before you can enter the `rx` command to view its state.


Receive 4096 samples to a CSV file:
```
rx config file=samples.csv format=csv n=4096
rx start
```

Files can also be transmitted:

```
tx config file=samples.bin
tx start
```

The transmission of the file can be repeated a number of times, with a configurable delay (microseconds) between each repetition:

```
tx config file=samples.bin repeat=100 delay=10000
tx start
```

While `format=csv` is valid for `tx`, note that the CLI will first convert the CSV to a temporary binary file:

```
bladeRF&gt; tx config file=samples.txt format=csv repeat=10 delay=10000000
bladeRF&gt; tx start

Converted CSV file to binary file. Using /tmp/bladeRF-ddLNmc
Note that this program will not delete the temporary file.

bladeRF&gt; tx

    State: Running
    File: /tmp/bladeRF-ddLNmc
    Format: C16, Binary (Little Endian)
    Repeat: 10 iterations
    Repeat delay: 10000000 us
```

## Creating a setup.txt ##
It was useful in debugging to get into a known state easily and reproducibly.  We created a `setup.txt` file which can be provided via the -s command line option.

Below is an example `setup.txt`:

```
set frequency 1000000000  # Tune to 1 GHz on both RX and TX
set samplerate 10000000   # Sample @ 10 MHz
set bandwidth 28000000    # 28 MHz bandwidth

# Configure gains
set lnagain bypass
set txvga1 -14
set txvga2 20
set rxvga1 20
set rxvga2 20

# Print out a few settings

print frequency
print samplerate
print bandwidth
```
